<!-- git init ===> this program support with git -->


<!-- git config --global ===> Send your Information -->


<!-- git add index.html ===> save program to git -->
<!-- git add *.html ===> save any html files that there's in the folder -->
<!-- git add . ===> save every files  -->


<!-- git rm --cached index.html ===> Remove program from git -->


<!-- git status ===> Check the git -->


<!-- When you change the program it must remove from git Automaticlly
 in this issuses we must add it again in git -->


<!-- git commit -m ' '  ===> it's another way to save program 
  with some informations
  e.g. git commit -m "Changed Code" or
  git commit -m "Add a button" -->


<!-- if you need to add all files in git but one file, do this
   at first create a folder named "gitignore" with text format ".txt"
   then write that name file in this
   now if you write "git add ." all files are added but that file you don't want -->
<!-- touch .gitignore -->
<!-- movie.app -->
<!-- git add . -->


<!--    Change the code Without Change the main   -->
    
<!--    git branch text-feature (YOUR FILE)
        git checkout text-feature
                ...CHANGING...
        git commit -m "e.g. Change the code"
        git checkout main 
        git merge text-feature  
        git add .
        git commit -m'change is done' -->

<!-- git branch ... ===> sometimes we wanna change our program without
 touching it, so Branch will copy our program then we change out copy program

 than write
 git checkout ... ===> we got a separate code, now we can set our codes
 on this version
 then we must save the code with "git commit -m "Change the code""

 now we must write
 git checkout main ===> get back to the main code
 (with "checkout" we go to the code that we want and target)

 now the most important, we need to push the change code in the main code
 write
 git merge text-feature ===> it pushes change code to the main code
  -->

<!-- git checkout -b ... ===> it's like 
     git branch text-text
     git checkout text-text
     it's just a shortcut -->
